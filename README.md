# AtomFPU

AtomFPU is an IEEE-754 Single Precision standard compliant Floating Point Unit developed and maintained by [chiphackers](https://chiphackers.com).
 It can be re-used inside ALUs and Microprocessors like [AtomRV32](https://github.com/chiphackers/AtomRV32). Calculations are
made efficient using algorithms like Modified booth algorithm for Multiplication.

# Status

This design is in alpha stage therefore it is not ready to be used. Need to improve performance and reduce amount of combinational logic
